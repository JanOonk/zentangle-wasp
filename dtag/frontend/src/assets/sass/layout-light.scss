// These are the layout SCSS classes that are used to generate the CSS classes that are in the same directory,
// and with the same name. Angular only uses the SCSS files at compile time, and the layout-light.scss file
// is called from the main styles.scss file for the application. The layout-light.css file was left only as
// a reference, and it will not be used on build time.
